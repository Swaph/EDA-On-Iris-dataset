# EDA-On-Iris-dataset
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset

## Introduction
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between the different features.

## Project Overview
This notebook walks through the process of exploring the Iris dataset, visualizing the data, and identifying key patterns. The main steps include:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
2. **Loading the Dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded directly from the Seaborn library and also included in the repository for reference.
3. **Data Exploration**: Key statistics and visualizations are generated to explore the relationships between the features.
4. **Visualizations**: Different types of plots, including scatter plots and pair plots, are used to visualize the data and discover patterns.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you will need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the notebook `EDA_on_Iris_Dataset.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in this repository as `iris.csv` for easy reference. If you wish to load it from the local file instead of the Seaborn library, you can modify the loading cell accordingly.

## Visualizations

The notebook generates a variety of visualizations to explore the Iris dataset, including:

- Pair plots to visualize relationships between features.
- Distribution plots to understand the spread of each feature.
- Scatter plots to observe correlations.

## Conclusion

This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of the Iris dataset, highlighting important relationships and patterns within the data. These insights can be used as a foundation for building more complex machine learning models.
